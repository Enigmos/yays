Translations
============

If you would like to provide or contribute to a translation, please send me
your email address and I will give you write access to a [Google Spreadsheet][spreadsheet]
where you can conveniently edit your translation and keep it up to date.

*So please, don't send me pull requests for translations.*

Acknowledgement

Thanks for all the [contributors][translators] who helped to better integrate
this script into YouTube.
